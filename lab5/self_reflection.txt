You must answer at least 4 questions, but the remaining ones are optional. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: Where is the staff solution?

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: Nothing special.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Maybe Nothing.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: No partner:( //Well, actually, it's no need to have a partner if you are doing self-learning.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: Treating it as circular.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: Maybe Nothing.
